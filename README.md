# ESP-IDF Examples

This repository contains a collection of examples that showcase the features and capabilities of the Espressif IoT Development Framework (ESP-IDF). The examples in this repository demonstrate how to use the ESP-IDF to work with various peripherals, such as UART, SPI and etc.

## Getting Started

To get started with these examples, you will need to have the ESP-IDF installed on your machine. Please follow the [official installation guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html) to set up your development environment.

Once you have the ESP-IDF installed, you can clone this repository to your machine and navigate to the directory of any example you want to try out. Each example has its own `README.md` file that provides instructions on how to build and run the example.

## Examples

The following is a list of the examples contained in this repository:

- **Blink:** This example shows how to blink an LED using the ESP-IDF.
- **SPI:** This example demonstrates how to use the ESP-IDF to communicate with a device using the SPI protocol.
- **UART:** This example shows how to use the ESP-IDF to communicate with a device using the UART protocol.

## Contributions

If you have an example that you would like to share with the community, we welcome pull requests! Please consider adding a brief `README.md` file to your example that explains what it does and how to run it and the output.
